To run the application, ensure that the java 8 jvm is being used. This on testing computers can be found at /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle.

Currently, the easiest supported codecs are AAC encoded MP4 files. Further codecs will be supported in future
releases.

The code can be built if required by using the gradle build tool.

The project also will also have a save file functionality for saving the project, which will save
the values of several of the buttons and sliders.
